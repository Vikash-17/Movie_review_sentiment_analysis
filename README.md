# Sentiment Analysis using Machine Learning

## Introduction
This project implements Sentiment Analysis on text data using machine learning techniques. Sentiment analysis, also known as opinion mining, is a natural language processing (NLP) task that determines whether a given piece of text expresses a **positive**, **negative**, or **neutral** sentiment.

The project is built as part of a hands-on learning exercise in NLP, showcasing data preprocessing, feature extraction, model building, and evaluation.

## Features
- Text preprocessing (cleaning, stopword removal, tokenization)
- Feature extraction using TF-IDF / Bag of Words
- Classification models applied for sentiment prediction
- Model performance evaluation (accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score)
- Visualization of results

## Results
- Achieved good classification performance on sentiment prediction
- Visualized confusion matrix and accuracy scores
- Demonstrated effectiveness of ML models for NLP

## Future Work
- Explore deep learning models (RNN, LSTM, Transformers) for better accuracy
- Deploy as a web application / API for real-time sentiment analysis
- Experiment with pretrained embeddings (Word2Vec, GloVe, BERT)
